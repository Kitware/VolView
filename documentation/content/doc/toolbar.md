## 2D Annotations

### Paint

When the paint tool is selected, you can paint in any 2D window. Click on the paint tool a second time to bring up a menu of colors and adjust the brush size.

### Ruler

When the ruler tool selected, the left mouse button is used to place and adjust ruler end-markers. Right clicking on a end-marker displays a pop-up menu for deleting that ruler. Switch to the "Annotations" tab to see a list of annotations made to currently loaded data. Select the location icon next to a listed ruler to jump to its slice. Select the trashcan to delete that ruler.

### Rectangle

When the rectangle tool selected, the left mouse button is used to place and adjust rectangle control points. Right click a rectangle end-marker to delete it. The "Annotations" tab lists all rectangles and provides jump-to, color editing, and delete controls.
