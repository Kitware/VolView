# Deployment Overview

VolView is a client-side application, which means deploying VolView does not have much overhead. That being said, this section of the documentation will cover some common deployment environments that may be of interest.

Generally, most deployments follow a similar pattern:

1. [Building VolView for production](./building_for_production)
2. [Hosting VolView](./hosting_volview)

The other articles in this section cover other scenarios that may be applicable to your situation.
