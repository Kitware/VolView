### Data

**Sample Data** presents a variety of DICOM data that can be used to quickly explore the capabilities of VolView. When you select a sample dataset, that data is downloaded from [http://data.kitware.com/](https://data.kitware.com/#collection/586fef9f8d777f05f44a5c86/folder/634713cf11dab81428208e1e).

### Annotations

Lists the ruler and other measures that have been made on the currently loaded data.

### Rendering

## Load / Save State

Restore or create a local file that captures the current configuration of the application and its data. This includes the layout, annotations, cinematic rendering settings, and all other options specified. The local file is in json format, so it provides a basis for integrating VolView with other applications and workflows.
